      <p>
        Its commonly found that more and more people are finding it difficult to
        cope up with socially competitive environment we are living in with peer
        pressure, fear of society or sometimes loneliness. Many voices are shut
        down and several others don't find the right audience to express
        themselves or find themselves to be inferior on bigger social media
        platforms. We all need an ear for our voice, a listener to our views,
        without being judged. We need a platform to express ourselves, share our
        smallest success or failures or motivate each other.
